# Left shift operation with hexadecimal values
'''What is the result of following expression:
x = 0x1F
result = x << 3
a. 0xF8 c. 0xF0
b. 0x7C d. 0xF7
'''
# EXPLANATION:
# This problem involves bit shifting operations using hexadecimal notation.
#
# "0x" prefix:
# - "0x" indicates that the number is in hexadecimal format (base 16)
# - This is a standard notation in many programming languages
# - Without this prefix, Python would interpret the number as decimal
#
# Given information:
# - x = 0x1F (hexadecimal number 1F, which is 31 in decimal)
# - The operation is x << 3 (left shift by 3 positions)
#
# Step 1: Convert 0x1F to binary
# 0x1F = 00011111 in binary (8-bit representation)
#    1    F
#   0001 1111
#
# Step 2: Perform the left shift (x << 3)
# Left shifting moves all bits 3 positions to the left, filling with zeros on the right
# 00011111 << 3 = 11111000
#
# Step 3: Convert the binary result back to hexadecimal
# 11111000 = F8 in hexadecimal = 0xF8
#
# Therefore, the result of x = 0x1F, result = x << 3 is 0xF8

# Code verification:
x = 0x1F            # 31 in decimal
result = x << 3     # Shift left by 3 positions
print("x in decimal:", x)
print("x in binary:", bin(x))
print("x in hexadecimal:", hex(x))
print("result in decimal:", result)
print("result in binary:", bin(result))
print("result in hexadecimal:", hex(result))
