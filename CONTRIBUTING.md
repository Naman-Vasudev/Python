# 🤝 Contributing to Python Learning Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project began as a semester effort but has grown into a collaborative Python learning resource. It includes tutorials, practice problems, and beginner-friendly projects — and we welcome your additions!

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Please familiarize yourself with the current folder structure:

- `tutorials/` – Python basics, syntax, OOP, sorting/searching, GUI (Tkinter).
- `questions/` – Practice problems and solutions from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, HackerRank.
- `projects/` *(optional)* – Small Python-based projects (if added in the future).

---

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

> 🛑 All contributions must be submitted via **Pull Requests**.  
> 🔒 Direct pushing to `main` is **restricted and requires approval**.

### 💡 What You Can Contribute

- **New practice problems** with clear code and comments.
- **Solved questions** from LeetCode/GFG/HackerRank (please mention the platform and problem name).
- **Corrections or improvements** to tutorials or examples.
- **Mini-projects** using Tkinter or other beginner-friendly libraries.

---

### 📌 Folder and File Naming Rules

- Create a new folder for your set if needed (e.g., `questions/recursion/`).
- Use **snake_case** for file names: `binary_search_solution.py`
- Add comments explaining your logic inside the code.
- Avoid uploading unnecessary files like `.DS_Store`, `.pyc`, etc.

## 🧪 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repo.
2. **Clone** your fork.
3. **Create a new branch**:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Add your files** to the correct folder.
5. **Commit** your changes with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added solution to GFG array rotation"
   ```
6. **Push to your fork** and open a **Pull Request**.
7. Wait for the review and approval before it’s merged.

## 👤 Maintainer Approval

Only the repository owner (currently **Naman Vasudev**) can approve and merge Pull Requests into the main branch. This ensures content consistency and quality.

---

## 🚫 What *Not* to Do

- Don’t push directly to `main` (it's protected).
- Don’t submit copied or plagiarized solutions.
- Don’t rename existing folders/files unless necessary and discussed.
