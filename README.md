# Python Learning Repository

This repository was initially created for a semester requirement but has since evolved into a personal project to track and showcase my learning progress in Python. It includes various tutorials, concepts, and coding challenges that I’ve encountered and solved.

## Contents

### 1. **Python Syntax and Basics**
   - Basic syntax and operators.
   - Data types and variables.
   - Control flow (if, else, loops).

### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Introduction to classes and objects.
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### 3. **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
   - Basic algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Binary Search.
   - Time and space complexity considerations.

### 4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) - Tkinter**
   - Simple GUI applications using Tkinter.
   - Widgets like buttons, labels, and entry fields.

### 5. **Problem Solving and Practice Questions**
   - A collection of beginner to intermediate-level problems from various platforms:
     - **LeetCode**
     - **GeeksforGeeks**
     - **HackerRank**
   - Problem sets include topics like arrays, strings, sorting, searching, and more.

## Usage

- Clone the repo and explore each folder for specific tutorials or problems.
- Feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests with solutions or improvements.

# 🤝 Contributing to Python Learning Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project began as a semester effort but has grown into a collaborative Python learning resource. It includes tutorials, practice problems, and beginner-friendly projects — and we welcome your additions!

## 📁 Repository Structure

Please familiarize yourself with the current folder structure:

- `tutorials/` – Python basics, syntax, OOP, sorting/searching, GUI (Tkinter).
- `questions/` – Practice problems and solutions from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, HackerRank.
- `projects/` *(optional)* – Small Python-based projects (if added in the future).

---

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

> 🛑 All contributions must be submitted via **Pull Requests**.  
> 🔒 Direct pushing to `main` is **restricted and requires approval**.

### 💡 What You Can Contribute

- **New practice problems** with clear code and comments.
- **Solved questions** from LeetCode/GFG/HackerRank (please mention the platform and problem name).
- **Corrections or improvements** to tutorials or examples.
- **Mini-projects** using Tkinter or other beginner-friendly libraries.

---

### 📌 Folder and File Naming Rules

- Create a new folder for your set if needed (e.g., `questions/recursion/`).
- Use **snake_case** for file names: `binary_search_solution.py`
- Add comments explaining your logic inside the code.
- Avoid uploading unnecessary files like `.DS_Store`, `.pyc`, etc.
