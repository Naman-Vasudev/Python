# Python Learning Repository

This repository was initially created for a semester requirement but has since evolved into a personal project to track and showcase my learning progress in Python. It includes various tutorials, concepts, and coding challenges that Iâ€™ve encountered and solved.

## Contents

### 1. **Python Syntax and Basics**
   - Basic syntax and operators.
   - Data types and variables.
   - Control flow (if, else, loops).

### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Introduction to classes and objects.
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### 3. **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
   - Basic algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Binary Search.
   - Time and space complexity considerations.

### 4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) - Tkinter**
   - Simple GUI applications using Tkinter.
   - Widgets like buttons, labels, and entry fields.

### 5. **Problem Solving and Practice Questions**
   - A collection of beginner to intermediate-level problems from various platforms:
     - **LeetCode**
     - **GeeksforGeeks**
     - **HackerRank**
   - Problem sets include topics like arrays, strings, sorting, searching, and more.

## Usage
